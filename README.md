# discovery_piscine

This repository contains solutions and exercises for the Discovery Piscine, organized by module and exercise.

## Structure

- Each module (`module00`, `module01`, ..., `module09`) contains several exercises (`ex00`, `ex01`, etc.).
- Some modules include a PDF file with instructions or theory.
- Exercises are implemented in Python and cover a range of programming concepts, including:
  - Basic input/output
  - String and array manipulation
  - Functions and conditionals
  - Dictionaries and filtering
  - Command-line arguments

## Example

A typical exercise file might look like this:

```python
def upcase_it(word):
    return word.upper()

print(upcase_it("hello"))
```
